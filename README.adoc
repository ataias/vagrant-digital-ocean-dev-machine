= Vagrant Dev Machine with Digital Ocean

This project contains a Vagrantfile with Ansible provisioning to setup a ubuntu dev machine with common dev tools like:

* https://ohmyz.sh[oh-my-zsh]
* https://www.docker.com[docker] and docker-compose
* https://github.com/sharkdp/fd[fd-find]
* https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep[ripgrep]

== Motivation

I do not always want to install certain dev environments on my machine or I may have limitations on my local machine (like using a Macbook M1 when docker and vms are in alpha/beta or a Raspberry Pi) that motivate one to develop on the cloud.

A cloud setup nowadays can be quite effective with a tool like https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview[VSCode Remote Development] which allows you to connect to a VM or Docker image seemlessly.
